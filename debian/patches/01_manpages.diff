+.TH AAFLIP 1 "December 17, 2001"
+.SH NAME
+aaflip \- An ASCII art video player
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B aaflip
+.RB [\| \-abcfv \|]
+.RB [\| \-n
+.RB number \|]
+.RB [\| \-s
+.RB delay \|]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B aaflip
+is an ASCII art video player which supports the fli and flc formats.
+.PP
+fli files are limited to a resolution of 320x200 pixel, while flc files can
+have any resolution.
+.PP
+The default method of playing is to load the first frame of the animation
+sequence and display it. After this the remainder of the file is loaded
+into memory, and the animation starts. The animation ends when q or ctrl-c
+is pressed.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B \-a
+Remove frames from memory after processing. Using this option leaves more
+memory for other processes, but relies on the buffer cache for continuous
+animation.
+.TP
+.B \-b
+Process frames immediately as they are loaded. When using this option the
+animation frames are shown as soon as the player has read them, so you don't
+have to wait until the entire file has been read. The disadvantage is that the
+animation becomes jumpy if the speed set by the animation is higher than the
+speed of loading.
+.TP
+.B \-c
+Keep the screen black while loading the animation. This conflicts with option
+.BR -b ,
+which can give interesting results.
+.TP
+.B \-f
+Switch off clock synchronization. Animation will run as fast as possible.
+.TP
+.B \-v
+Show information on flic file.
+.TP
+.B "\-n number"
+Play the animation sequence 
+.I number
+times.
+.TP
+.B "\-s delay"
+Set delay between frames to 
+.I delay
+milliseconds. Option 
+.B "\-s 0"
+is the same as 
+.BR \-f .
+.SH BUGS
+Please report any bugs you find to Jan Hubicka <hubicka@freesoft.cz>.
